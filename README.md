# Blackjack simulation

## Game Description

Blackjack is a popular casino game. Each player bets against the house (dealer). Using the correct strategy and adding card counting techniques the players could gain advantage in order to reduce the average losses significantly.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to get used to the ProjectTemplate package in R. This package allows me to automate data analysis by building pipelines:
* Loading required packages  
* Loading data sets into memory  
* Data wrangling and preprocessing into a form that's suitable for analysis

In addition, ProjectTemplate package includes unit testing features in order to make sure that separate parts of the code work as expected.

I developed game rules such as dealing and shuffling of cards, counting hand values and comparing the values to the dealer.

The function of interest is calculation of winnings which is used in the second part of the analysis. The analysis shows that applying best choices strategy do not significantly outperform random guessing strategy.

**Final reports could be found in _reports_ directory**

TODO: add card counting strategy and compare it to the previous two. Does it allows to get profit long-term?
