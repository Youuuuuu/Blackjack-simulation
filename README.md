# Blackjack simulation

Blackjack is a popular casino game. Each player bet against the house (dealer). Using correct strategy and adding card counting techniques the players could reduce the average losses significantly and gain advantage.

The goal of this project is to get used to ProjectTemplate package in R. This package allows to automate data analysis by building pipelines:
* Loading required packages  
* Loading data sets into memory  
* Data wrangling and preprocessing into a form that's suitable for analysis

In addition ProjectTemplate package include unit testing features in order to make sure that separate parts of the code work as expected.

Firstly I develop game rules such dealing and shuffling of cards, counting of hand value and comparing the values to the dealer.

The function of interest is calculation of winings which is used in the second part of the analysis. The analysis shows that applying best choices strategy do not significantly outperform random guessing strategy.

**Final reports could be found in _reports_ directory**

TODO: add card counting strategy and compare it to the previous two. Does it allows to get profit long-term?
